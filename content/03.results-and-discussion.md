# Results and Discussion

## Scalability, Portability, and Efficiency

The re-implementation of EAGER into Nextflow offers a range of benefits over the
original custom pipeline framework.

Firstly, the new framework provides immediate integration of nf-core/eager into
various job schedulers in POSIX High-Performance-Cluster (HPC) environments,
cloud computing resources, as well as local workstations. This portability
allows users to set up nf-core/eager regardless of the type of computing
infrastructure or cluster size (if applicable), with minimal effort or
configuration. This facilitates reproducibility and therefore maintenance of
standards within the field. Portability is further assisted by the in-built
compatibility with software environments and containers such as Conda
[@url:https://conda.io], Docker [@url:https://www.docker.com] and Singularity
[@url:https://sylabs.io]. These are isolated software 'sandbox' environments
that include all software (with exact versions) required by the pipeline, in a
form that is installable and runnable by users regardless of the set up of their
local software environment. Another major change with nf-core/eager is that the
primary user interaction mode of a pipeline run set up is now with a
command-line interface (CLI), replacing the graphical-user-interface (GUI) of
the original EAGER pipeline. This is more portable and compatible with most HPCs (that
may not offer display of a window system), and is in line with the vast majority
of bioinformatics tools. We therefore believe this will not be a hindrance to
new researchers from outside computational biology. However, a GUI-based
pipeline set up is still avaliable via the nf-core website's Launch page
[@url:https://nf-co.re/launch], which provides a common
GUI format across multiple pipelines, as well as additional robustness checks of
input parameters for those less familiar with CLIs. Typically the output of the
launch functionality is a JSON file that can be used with a nf-core/tools launch
command as a single parameter (similar to the original EAGER), however
integration with Nextflow's companion monitoring tool tower.nf
[@url:https://tower.nf] also allows direct submission of pipelines without any
command line usage.

Secondly, reproducibility is made easier through the use of 'profiles' that can
define configuration parameters. These profiles can be managed at different
hierarchical levels. *HPC-level profiles* can specify parameters for the computing
environment (job schedulers, cache locations for containers, maximum memory and
CPU resources etc.), which can be centrally managed to ensure all users of a
group use the same settings. *Pipeline-level profiles*, specifying parameters for
nf-core/eager itself, allow fast access to routinely-run pipeline parameters via a
single flag in the nf-core/eager run command, without having to configure each
new run from scratch. Compared to the original EAGER, which utilised per-FASTQ
XML files with hardcoded filepaths for a specific user's server, nf-core/eager
allows researchers to publish the specific profile used in their runs alongside
their publications, that can also be used by other groups to generate the same
results. Usage of profiles can also reduce mistakes caused by insufficient
'prose' based reporting of program settings that can be regularly found in the
literature. The default nf-core/eager profile uses parameters evaluated in
different aDNA-specific contexts (e.g. in [@doi:10.1186/1471-2164-13-178]), and
will be updated in each new release as new studies are published.

Finally, nf-core/eager provides improved efficiency over the original EAGER
pipeline by replacing sample-by-sample sequential processing with Nextflow's
asynchronous job parallelisation, whereby multiple pipeline steps and samples
are run in parallel (in addition to natively parallelised pipeline steps). This
is similar to the approach taken by PALEOMIX, however nf-core/eager expands this
by utilising Nextflow's ability to customise the resource parameters for every
job in the pipeline; reducing unnecessary resource allocation that can occur
with unfamiliar users to each step of a high-throughput short-read data
processing pipeline. This is particularly pertinent given the increasing use of
centralised HPCs or cloud computing that often use per-hour cost calculations.

## Updated Workflow

nf-core/eager follows a similar structural foundation to the original version of
EAGER and partially to PALEOMIX. Given Illumina short-read FASTQ and/or BAM
files and a reference FASTA file, the core functionality of nf-core/eager can be split in five
main stages:

1. Pre-processing
   - Sequencing quality control: FastQC

3. aDNA evaluation and modification
   - Damage profiling: DamageProfiler [@doi:10.1101/2020.10.01.322206]
   - aDNA reads selection: PMDtools [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1318934111]

   - Human nuclear contamination estimation: ANGSD [@doi:10.1186/s12859-014-0356-4]
4. Variant calling and consensus sequence generation: GATK UnifiedGenotyper and HaploTypeCaller
   [@doi:10.1101/gr.107524.110], ANGSD [@doi:10.1186/s12859-014-0356-4], sequenceTools pileupCaller [@url:https://github.com/stschiff/sequenceTools],
   VCF2Genome [@doi:10.1186/s13059-016-0918-z], MultiVCFAnalyzer [@doi:10.1038/nature13591]
5. Report generation: MultiQC [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btw354]

In nf-core/eager, all tools originally used in EAGER have been updated to their
latest versions, as available on Bioconda [@doi:10.1038/s41592-018-0046-7] and
Conda-forge [@url:https://conda-forge.github.io], to ensure widespread
accessibility and stability of utilised tools. The mapDamage2 (for damage
profile generation) [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btt193] and Schmutzi (for
mitochondrial contamination estimation) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-015-0776-0] methods
have not been carried over to nf-core/eager, the first because a more performant
successor method is now available (DamageProfiler), and the latter because a
stable release of the method could not be migrated to Bioconda. We anticipate
that there will be an updated version of Schmutzi in the near future that will
allow us to integrate the method again into nf-core/eager. As an alternative,
estimation of human _nuclear_ contamination is now offered through
ANGSD [@doi:10.1186/s12859-014-0356-4]. Support for the Bowtie2 aligner
[@doi:10.1038/nmeth.1923] has been updated to have default settings optimised
for aDNA [@doi:10.3389/fevo.2020.00105].

New tools to the basic workflow include fastp
[@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bty560] for the removal of 'poly-G' sequencing
artefacts that are common in 2-colour Illumina sequencing machines (such as the
increasingly popular NextSeq and NovaSeq platforms
[@url:https://sequencing.qcfail.com/articles/illumina-2-colour-chemistry-can-overcall-high-confidence-g-bases/]).
For variant calling, we have now included FreeBayes [@arxiv:1207.3907] as an
alternative to the human-focused GATK tools, and have also added pileupCaller
[@url:https://github.com/stschiff/sequenceTools] for generation of genotyping
formats commonly utilised in ancient human population analysis. We have also
maintained the possibility of using the now unsupported GATK UnifiedGenotyper,
as the supported replacement, GATK HaplotypeCaller, performs _de novo_ assembly
around possible variants; something that may not be suitable for low-coverage
aDNA data.

bubbles indicate new functionality added over the original EAGER
pipeline.](images/eager2_workflow.png){#fig:workflow-schematic width="90%"}

Additional functionality tailored for ancient bacterial genomics includes
integration of a SNP alignment generation tool, MultiVCFAnalyzer
[@doi:10.1038/nature13591], which includes the ability to make an assessment of
levels of cross-mapping from different related taxa to a reference genome - a
common challenge in ancient bacterial genome reconstruction
[@doi:10.1146/annurev-genom-091416-035526]. The output SNP consensus alignment
FASTA file can then be used for downstream analyses such as phylogenetic tree
construction. Simple coverage statistics of particular annotations (e.g. genes)
of an input reference is offered by bedtools
[@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btq033], which can be used in cases such as for
providing initial indications of functional differences between ancient
bacterial strains (as in [@doi:10.1016/j.cub.2017.10.025]). When using a human
reference genome, nf-core/eager can also give estimates of the relative coverage
on the X and Y chromosomes with Sex.DetERRmine that can be used to infer the
biological sex of a given human individual [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-07483-5]. A
dedicated 'endogenous DNA' calculator (endorS.py) is also included, to provide a
percentage estimate of the sequenced reads matching the reference ('on-target')
from the total number of reads sequenced per library.

Given the large amount of sequencing often required to yield sufficient genome
coverage from aDNA data, palaeogeneticists tend to use multiple (differently
treated) libraries, and/or merge data from multiple sequencing runs of each
library or even samples. The original EAGER pipeline could only run a single
library at a time, and in these contexts required significant manual user input
in merging different FASTQ or BAM files of related libraries. A major upgrade in
nf-core/eager is that the new pipeline supports automated processing of complex
sequencing strategies for many samples, similar to PALEOMIX. This is facilitated
by the optional use of a simple table (in TSV format, a format more
commonly used in wet-lab stages of data generation, compared to PALEOMIX's YAML
format) that includes file paths and additional metadata such as sample name,
library name, sequencing lane, colour chemistry, and UDG treatment. This allows
automated and simultaneous processing and appropriate merging and treatment of
heterogeneous data from multiple sequencing runs and/or library types.

The original EAGER  and PALEOMIX pipelines required users to look through many
independent output directories and files to make full assessment of their
sequencing data. This has now been replaced in nf-core/eager with a much more
extensive MultiQC report [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btw354]. This tool
aggregates the log files of every supported tool into a single interactive
report, and assists users in making a fuller assessment of their sequencing and
analysis runs. We have developed a corresponding MultiQC module for every tool
used by nf-core/eager, where possible, to enable comprehensive evaluation of all
stages of the pipeline.

We have further extended the functionality of the original EAGER pipeline by
adding ancient metagenomic analysis; allowing reconstruction of the wider
taxonomic content of a sample. We have added the possibility to screen all
off-target reads (not mapped to the reference genome) with two metagenomic
profilers: MALT [@doi:10.1101/050559; @doi:10.1038/s41559-017-0446-6] and
Kraken2 [@doi:10.1186/s13059-019-1891-0], in parallel to the mapping to a given
reference genome (typically of the host individual, assuming the sample is a
host organism). Characterisation of properties of authentic aDNA from
metagenomic MALT alignments is carried out with MaltExtract of the HOPS pipeline
[@doi:10.1186/s13059-019-1903-0]. This functionality can be used either for
microbiome screening or putative pathogen detection. Ancient metagenomic studies
sometimes include comparative samples from living individuals
[@doi:10.1186/s40168-019-0717-3)]. To support open data, whilst respecting
personal data privacy, nf-core/eager includes a 'FASTQ host removal' script that
creates raw FASTQ files, but with all reads successfully mapped to the reference
genome removed. This allows for safe upload of metagenomic non-host sequencing
data to public repositories after removal of identifiable (human) data, for
example for microbiome studies.

An overview of the entire pipeline is shown in Figure {@fig:workflow-schematic},
and a tabular comparison of functionality between EAGER, PALEOMIX and
nf-core/eager is in Table {@tbl:pipeline-comparison}.

To demonstrate the simultaneous genomic analysis of human DNA and metagenomic
screening for putative pathogens, as well as improved results reporting, we
re-analysed data from Barquera et al. 2020 [@doi:10.1016/j.cub.2020.04.002], who
performed a multi-discipline study of three 16th century individuals excavated
from a mass burial site in Mexico City. The authors reported genetic results
showing sufficient on-target human DNA (>1%) with typical aDNA damage (>20% C to
T reference mismatches in the first base of the 5' ends of reads) for downstream
population-genetic analysis and Y-chromosome coverage indicative that the three
individuals were genetically male. In addition, one individual (Lab ID: SJN003)
contained DNA suggesting a possible infection by _Treponema pallidum_, a species
with a variety of strains that can cause diseases such as syphilis, bejel and
yaws, and a second individual (Lab ID: SJN001) displayed reads similar to the
Hepatitis B virus. Both results were confirmed by the authors via in-solution
enrichment approaches.

We were able to successfully replicate the human and pathogen screening results
in a single run of nf-core/eager. Mapping to the human reference genome (hs37d5)
with BWA aln and binning of off-target reads with MALT to the NCBI Nucleotide
database (2017-10-26), yielded the same results of all individuals having a
biological sex of male, as well as the same frequency of C to T miscoding
lesions and short fragment lengths (both characteristic of true aDNA).
Metagenomic hits to both pathogens from the corresponding individuals that also
yielded complete genomes in the original publication were also detected. Both
results and other processing statistics were identified via a single interactive
MultiQC report, excerpts of which can be seen in Figure
{@fig:dual-human-pathogen}. The full interactive report can be seen in the
supplementary information.

## Accessibility

Alongside the interactive MultiQC report, we have written extensive
documentation on all parts of running and interpreting the output of the
pipeline. Given that a large fraction of aDNA researchers come from fields
outside computational biology, and thus may have limited computational training,
we have written documentation and tutorials [@url:https://nf-co.re/eager/docs]
that also gives guidance on how to run the pipeline and interpret each section
of the report in the context of high-throughput sequencing data, but with with a
special focus on aDNA. This includes best practice or expected output schematic
images that are published under CC-BY licenses to allow for use in other
training material (an example can be seen in Figure {@fig:doc-image-example}).
We hope this open-access resource will make the study of aDNA more accessible to
researchers new to the field, by providing practical guidelines on how to
evaluate characteristics and effects of aDNA on downstream analyses.

users in the interpretation of high-throughput sequencing aDNA
processing.](images/fastqc_adapter_content.png){#fig:doc-image-example
width="70%"}

The development of nf-core/eager in Nextflow and the nf-core initiative will
also improve open-source development, while ensuring the high quality of
community contributions to the pipeline. While Nextflow is written primarily in
Groovy, the Nextflow DSL simplifies a number of concepts to an intermediate
level that bioinformaticians without Java/Groovy experience can easily access
(regardless of own programming language experience). Furthermore, Nextflow
places ubiquitous and more widely known command-line interfaces, such as bash,
in a prominent position within the code, rather than custom Java code and
classes (as in EAGER). We hope this will motivate further bug fixes and
feature contributions from the community, to keep the pipeline state-of-the-art
and ensure a longer life-cycle. This will also be supported by the open and
active nf-core community who provide general guidance and advice on developing
Nextflow and nf-core pipelines.

## Comparisons with other pipelines

The scope of nf-core/eager is as a generic, initial data processing and
screening tool, and not to act as a tool for performing more experimental
analyses that requires extensive parameter testing such as modelling. As such,
while similar pipelines designed for aDNA have also been released, for example
ATLAS [@doi:10.1101/105346], these generally have been designed with specific
contexts in mind (e.g. human population genetics). We therefore have opted to
not include common downstream analysis such as Principal Component Analysis for
population genetics, or phylogenetic analysis for microbial genomics, but rather
focus on ensuring nf-core/eager produces useful files that can be easily used as
input for common but more experimental and specialised downstream analysis.

Therefore, we compared pipeline run-times of two functionally equivalent and
previously published pipelines to show that the new implementation of
nf-core/eager is equivalent or more efficient than EAGER or PALEOMIX.

We ran each pipeline on a subset of Viking-age genomic data of cod (_Gadus
morhua_) from Star et al. 2017 [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1710186114]. This data was
originally run using PALEOMIX, and was re-run here as described, but with the
latest version of PALEOMIX (v1.2.14), and with equivalent settings for the other
two pipelines as close as possible to the original paper (EAGER with v1.92.33,
and nf-core/EAGER with v2.2.0dev, commit
830c22d). The respective benchmarking
environment and exact pipeline run settings can be seen in the Methods and
Supplementary Information. Two samples each with three Illumina paired-end
sequencing runs were analysed, with adapter clipping and merging
(AdapterRemoval), mapping (BWA aln), duplicate removal (Picard's MarkDuplicates)
and damage profiling (PALEOMIX: mapDamage2, EAGER and nf-core/EAGER:
DamageProfiler) steps being performed. We ran the commands for each tool
sequentially, but repeated these batches of commands 10 times - to account for
variability in the cloud service's IO connection. Run times were measured using
the GNU time tool (v1.7).

Table: Comparison of run times in minutes between three ancient DNA pipelines.
PALEOMIX and nf-core/eager have additional runs with 'optimised' parameters with
fairer computational resources matching modern multi-threading strategies.
Values represent mean and standard deviation of run times in minutes, calculated
from the output of the GNU time tool. Real: real time, System: cumulative CPU system-task times,
User: cumulative CPU time of all tasks. {#tbl:benchmarking-runtimes}

A summary of runtimes of the benchmarking tests can be seen in Table
{@tbl:benchmarking-runtimes}. nf-core/eager showed fastest runtimes across all
three time metrics when running on default parameters. This
highlights the improved efficiency of nf-core/eager's asynchronous processing
system and per-process resource customisation (here represented by nf-core/eager
defaults designed for typical HPC set ups).

As a more realistic demonstration of modern computing multi-threading set ups,
we also re-ran PALEOMIX with the flag --max-bwa-threads set to 4 (listed in
Table {@tbl:benchmarking-runtimes} as 'optimised'), which is equivalent to a
single BWA aln process of nf-core/eager. This resulted in a much faster run-time
than that of default nf-core/eager, due to the approach of PALEOMIX of mapping
each lane of a library separately, whereas nf-core/eager will map all lanes of a
single library merged together. Therefore, given that each library was split
across three lanes, increasing the threads of BWA aln to 4 resulted in 12 per
library, whereas nf-core/eager only gave 4 (by default) for a single BWA aln
process of one library. While the PALEOMIX approach is valid, we opted to retain
the per-library mapping as it is often the longest running step of
high-throughput sequencing genome-mapping pipelines, and it prevents flooding of
HPC scheduling systems with many long-running jobs. Secondly, if users regularly
use multi-lane data, due to nf-core/eager's fine-granularity control, they can
simply modify nf-core/eager's BWA aln process resources via config files to
account for this. When we optimised parameters that were used for BWA aln's
multi-threading, and the number of multiple lanes to the same number of BWA aln
threads as the optimised PALEOMIX run, nf-core/eager again displayed faster
runtimes. All metrics including mapped reads, percentage on-target, mean depth
coverage and mean read lengths across all pipelines were extremely similar
across all pipelines and replicates (see methods and Table
{@tbl:benchmarking-results}).
